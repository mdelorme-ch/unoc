        description: 'Because the earth is a globe, maps have to distort the earth in some way to be presented on a 2D surface. Each of these "ways of distorting" are what we GIS-folk call "map projections". The projection shown here is the Spilhaus Projection, which is handy for seeing all of the world\'s oceans (ocean?) in one place. I love that this projection forces us to realize how connected the oceans really are. I created this map as part of the 2023 #30daymapchallenge.',

Each reveals, in its own way, how changing ocean conditions impact marine life. By tracking environmental change in known habitat areas, we expose growing pressures over time. While this analysis simplifies a complex reality, it reveals clear signals of stress on key species. The data come from the Copernicus Marine Service and global habitat maps.',

In 1993, melting peaked from August to October; in 2023, it extended from July to November. Additional graphs show decreased ice thickness and a 7–8% drop in December ice area. December was chosen as a representative month, avoiding the extremes of March and September.',
